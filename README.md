The deployed project can be found at `https://watsons-diary.herokuapp.com/`.


Watson's Diary is a project which leverages IBM's Watson API for personal wellness. Text input by the user is passed to Watson Natural Language Understanding. Up to five keywords from the text are returned. Watson NLU provides emotion analysis where is predicts the joy, fear, disgust, anger, and sadness. These results are then displayed as a table and a radio chart using chart.js.


My original work with Watson NLU was in trying to determine a way to identify implicit bias in published works. However, my initial testing results did not return as expected - I believe that Watson does not yet have the capability to extrapolate to the degree I wanted it to.


As the application is currently deployed, it can be used to provide third party feedback on journaling. The purpose of this feedback is not to diminish the user's entry, but to provide additional insights and connections that the user might not make on their own as quickly.


I hope to continue working on this project - I would like to connect the application to a database to allow users to create an account to store their entries and responses. Given the ability to store and compare results over time, I hope to enable users to identify patterns of words that consistently register a strong emotional response. In addition to being a useful tool for an individual user, with this functionality, this may be a useful tool in the clinical rehabilitation setting. Many therapists encourage clients recovering from mental illness to journal regularly. Sometimes these journals can be shared in a session, however, oftentimes effective journalers cannot share their entries in sessions due to time constraints. However, with a tool like this, therapists can immediately identify patterns and keywords to focus on and provide more effective therapy.
